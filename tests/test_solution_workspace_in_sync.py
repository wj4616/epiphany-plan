"""INV-5 single-source resolver enforcement (S1).

The vendored copy of solution_workspace.py MUST be byte-identical to the
canonical goatcs-harness/shared/solution_workspace.py. We pin the canonical
sha256 here; the vendored copy is checked against it, so editing the vendored
copy fails this test (R-12). When the canonical source is locatable (a sibling
goatcs-harness checkout, or SOLUTION_WORKSPACE_CANONICAL env), we ALSO assert the
pin still equals the canonical hash, so the pin cannot silently go stale.
